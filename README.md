# RecoVR
Welcome to RecoVR, a VR game for improving adherence with at-home physical therapy for anterior cruciate ligament injury developed as part of my undergraduate honors thesis at Thayer School of Engineering, Dartmouth College during June-November 2022.
You can find the proof-of-concept version of the game, RecoVR_Nov22, in Assets > Scenes.
